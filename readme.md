# hidenseek-amongus (prototype)
### Hide'n'Seek Gamemode Plugin for [Impostor](https://github.com/impostor/impostor) Among Us Server.

### Play Hide'n'Seek with your friends!
#### Rules:
- Impostors are Seekers and Crewmates are Hiders. Hiders are white and Seekers are orange.
- First 20 seconds Hiders try to find spots to hide while Seekers are waiting on spawn.
- Once 20 seconds pass, Seekers become red and they can find and kill Hiders.
- Hiders can't report bodies or call emergency meetings, and Seekers can't sabotage except lowering light level.
- If Seekers can't find Hiders in 4 minutes, Seekers self-destruct and Hiders win.
- If there is 1 kill remains for Seekers to win, Hiders are colored black.

You can modify round time and hiding time with `setround <seconds>` and `sethide <seconds>` commands.
